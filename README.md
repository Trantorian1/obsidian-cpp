> This is a repository intended for the study of the C++ programming language, with a focus on version [C++98](https://cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/). As a result, some information might be out of date or considered as bad practices as compared to never version. Use at your own risk.

## Target Audience

This repository is mainly intended as a C++ tutorial with a fast takeoff for programmers with **prior experience in C and OOP.** While it is not strictly required, it is highly encouraged to have a background in these topics as otherwise important topics such as pointers, memory representation and certain optimization techniques and best practices will be skipped on the basis that the reader is already familiar with them. If you are not yet familiar with C, I suggest you start there.
